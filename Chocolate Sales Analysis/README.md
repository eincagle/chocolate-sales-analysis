# Chocolate Sales Performance Dashboard

## Overview

This project analyzes chocolate sales data from January to August 2022 to uncover trends in product performance, regional sales, and customer behavior. The workflow combines **Python (Pandas)** for data preprocessing and analysis, and **Tableau** for interactive dashboard visualization.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Pandas** – tabular data manipulation and feature engineering
- **Tableau** – dashboard design and interactive visual exploration
- **Jupyter Notebook** – end-to-end data pipeline and insight documentation

---

## Data Preprocessing

Using a Jupyter Notebook, the dataset was:

- Cleaned and formatted (e.g., removing currency symbols, standardizing column names)
- Converted from text-based dates to proper `datetime` objects
- Enhanced with derived features like `year`, `month`, and `total_sales`
- Exported to a clean `.csv` file for Tableau use

## Python Analysis Highlights

- **Monthly sales trends** to identify seasonality
- **Top products** by total revenue
- **Salesperson performance** breakdown
- **Sales by country**

## Tableau Dashboard

The final dashboard includes:

- A time-series line chart for monthly sales
- Bar charts showing top-selling products and top-performing regions
- A leaderboard for salesperson contributions
- An interactive filter for country, product, and salesperson
